## Robotics using ActivityBot
**COMP105P accomplishments while at UCL**
```
Code explained below are optimized for the simulator NOT for the actual robot
```
1. First file contains phase 1 of the final project. It has a wall following algorithm and stores neccessary variables
2. Second file contains phase 2.It uses information gathered from phase 1 to run Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path
3. Third file "finaltask_sh" contains the submitted version of the project. 


(I am supposed to combine phase1.c and phase2.c, but left it for the sake of providing my progression towards the final version of my project)

Note that this assumes a 4 x 4 grid of 40 - 60cm sided squares
